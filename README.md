3D scene reconstruction using camera and Lidar from KITTI dataset

In this prject , it is a question of implementing the knowledge acquired on projective geometry.

NOTE: Advanced knowledge in projective geometry is required to understand this project.

For this i suggest This Youtube channel  <a href="https://github.com/cherifsid/3D-scene-reconstruction-using-camera-and-Lidar-from-KITTI-dataset">[First Principles of Computer Vision
]</a>  to understand all computer vision and projective geometry bases.

In this part we will use the transformations provided by the Kitti dataset : https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/  to build a 3D model from cam and lidar information provided by KITTI dataset.

To visulaze this project result we need to draw all point with plyfile library (to open in MeshLab)
